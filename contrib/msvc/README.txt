[features]
 * [clamav] small footprint (all distribution is around 1.5 MiB - except llvm fat ;) dll)
 * [clamav] native win64 port
 * [clamav] support for unc paths, exotic/long file names
 * [clamav] nice icons ;)
 * [clamscan] memory scanner (in memory loaded modules are scanned on-disk)
 * [llvm] jit dll is optional, and since not supported on old os will be loaded dinamically
 * [freshclam] native dns txt query on win98/ME / DnsAPI query on Win2k+
 * [clamd/freshclam] also as Windows Services

[notes]
* You can store database and config paths in the registry using
  clamav.reg file (I may make a nsis installer in the future),
  paths can be also REG_EXPAND_SZ, environment variables are
  allowed here (i.e. you can use paths like %HomeDrive%\Clamav).

* To use binaries compiled with Visual Studio 2005,
  you need the msvcrt80 side by side assembly, the "simple way" is
  uncompress Microsoft.VC80.CRT.zip in the directory of executables,
  the directory Microsoft.VC80.CRT must be placed as is, putting
  directly dlls in the same directory of the executable will not work.
  On windows 9x you should put the dll and the manifest in windows
  system directory without the Microsoft.VC80.CRT directory.
  For more info about this refer to the relative msdn-page.
  You can also download the redist package directly from Microsoft.
